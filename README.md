# Probability-Distributions
This project allows users to calculate probability distributions by defining parameters. By entering values like lambda, users can compute probabilities for specific x values, such as in exponential or gamma distributions. Itâ€™s a flexible tool to explore various probability distributions and their parameter interactions.
